//
// Rather than only using the precompiled CSS with the default settings, the grid system can be customized
// by changing the variable values. This partial contains useful validations that check whether customizations
// are valid.
//
// The strategy is to:
//   1.) Raise errors when variable values would lead to compilation errors anyway. In this case the error
//       messages of the validations here are more useful than the generic compiler errors.
//   2.) Raise warnings when variable values don't make much sense but when the sources will compile
//       successfully.
